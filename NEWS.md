# News

All of the news in regards to changes will be posted here. Difference from Changelog is that this will contain compressed news and somewhat expanded explenations when needed. Will also list news outside of direct changes from changed packages/versions. (What was previously done with 'NOTE:..' in the README).

## 2025/6/2 New applets added, semi preparation for 10.10 eventual release

8 New applets were added to the repository. For now all them are made to work with mainly with Budgie-Desktop 10.9.2. They are not added to the meta ebuild to preserve those changes for when 10.10 releases and i split everything up in 2 meta ebuilds.

Some of them have patches to work with both 10.10 and 10.9.2 but having their wayland useflags disabled. This will be changed later when 10.10 releases (I have no idea when this will happen).

The added applets are:
- budgie-browser-profile-launcher
- budgie-cpufreq-applet
- budgie-cputemp-applet
- budgie-lightpad-applet (which launches lightpad)
- budgie-media-player-applet
- budgie-performance-gauge-applet
- budgie-user-indicator-redux-applet
- budgie-hostname-applet

Budgie-Desktop 10.10 status is still unknown. When that releases some small applets may be removed later. See Issues tab for more info.
