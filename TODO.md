# ToDo

Below are notes I have planned/may consider to do as well with their status. Things that have been checked will be added to the overlay public when it is tested for potetial problems on my end. Once public they will  be removed from this file.


### High

- [X] Update gentoo wiki Budgie section with instructions and introductions. Someone else did the groundwork, high time I finished it up and change/fix what is needed (some false info on it)
- [ ] Take a look at a default gtk theme to install with this when it is not installed with budgie-meta minimal useflag

### Medium

- [ ] Take a look at the logo's inside budgie-control-center and see if I need to add a gentoo mark on it. To make it consistant with other similar applications (gnome-control-center e.g.)


### Low

- [ ] Think about adding in the test useflag for budgie-control-center to mirror gnome-control-center and see if things are needed or wanted.
- [ ] Think about moving and expanding the F.A.Q. to another document/wiki ?
